/**
 * An abstraction over {@link BaseDataBoundAdapter} that keeps the list of children and can
 * support multiple item types.
 * <p>
 * This class relies on all layouts using the "data" variable to represent the item.
 * <p>
 * Although this class by itself just exists for demonstration purposes, it might be a useful idea
 * for an application to have a generic naming convention for their items to scale lists with
 * many view types.
 * <p>
 * Note that, by using this, you lose the compile time type checking for mapping your items to
 * layout files but at run time, it will still be checked. See
 * {@link android.databinding.ViewDataBinding#setVariable(int, Object)} for details.
